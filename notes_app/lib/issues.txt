Ah, classic Flutter gotcha 😄 — your dialog code itself is fine. The issue is almost always which BuildContext you’re using.
Since you mentioned that your Stateful widget contains a MaterialApp, this is the root of the problem.
What’s going wrong
showDialog needs a BuildContext that is below a Navigator.
When you put a MaterialApp inside a Stateful widget, you often end up calling showDialog with a context that belongs to a widget above the Navigator,
 so Flutter has nowhere to display the dialog → nothing appears, no error.
